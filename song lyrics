C-C-C-Careful of the Enderman he's
Black, he will get angry if you look at him and
Attack you, he's black, and he'll steal, he'll rob your blocks
He cannot swim, cannot swim at all
I'm in the deep, deep basement of
Mom's house, mining 'til I get to the next
Level, I just gotta build something big
Bigger than me and I'll be
Crafting in the basement all night
Minecraft won't add inches to your cock!
So mine it up-up-up
Mine it up-up-up
Mine it up-up-up
Build it higher!
So mine it up-up-up
Mine it up-up-up
Mine it up-up-up
To the sky
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
This is Minecraft
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
This is Minecraft
Zombies and Creepers and the
Spiders and the Skeletons, that carry bows and
Arrows I just gotta build a building that'll
Keep 'em from me, because the
Netherworld's the only thing
That waits for me
I'm always living in a Lego Land
In-vented by a Swedish Viking lookin'
Fat kid, gotta keep on building and survive-vive-vive
And then maybe somebody will have sex with me
Minecraft won't add inches to your cock
So mine it up-up-up

Mine it up-up-up
Build it higher!
